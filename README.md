## Info

This is a social media site where you can:        

* Create/Join/Leave galaxies (like groups on other social sites)       
* Post on galaxies after joining     
* See other user's activity      
* Delete posts or comments        

If you are not logged in you can still:        

* View galaxies and all the content        
* Post as visitor       
    
It has a galactic theme. So I also added some cool Javascript-made stars on the background for fun
              
           
## Technologies

For this project, I used **Django**, and some basic **Html**, **Css** and **Javascript**.       
It was my second project to deploy, and I learnt how to deploy it on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).
               
               
                 
## Motivation

It was the second full project on Django and I also tried to add my personal touch as much as I could, like the first one.       
_I was following Udemy's Course [Python and Django Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/share/101WisAEITeFhSTXoJ/)._
