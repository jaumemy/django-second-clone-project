# About this project

Spacer is a social media site, where you can create an account and join groups ( I called them galaxies as space is the theme of the web ).
Then you can post in a galaxy with other users.
Of course you can also leave galaxies, remove posts or check other users posts, among other common actions in social media sites.

Cloning a social media site!

I will try to host it on Heroku this time!


# Updated on Fri, Dec 4:
After a lot of final touches I finally was able to finish it and deploy it to Heroku.
If you feel curious, just sign up, join a galaxy or create one, and post something!
